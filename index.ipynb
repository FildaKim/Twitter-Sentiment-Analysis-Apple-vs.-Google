    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "In today's digital age, customer opinions on tech products are widely shared on social media platforms like Twitter. Understanding public sentiment towards brands like Apple and Google is crucial for businesses to assess customer satisfaction, improve marketing strategies, and address potential issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that can automatically classify the sentiment of tweets about Apple and Google products as positive, negative, or neutral. By analyzing real-world social media data, this model will help derive valuable insights into consumer perceptions."
